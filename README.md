# Sheriff

The bot handling DMs running on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/intellectualsites).

## Requirements

- Node 12.5.x
- Npm 7.x

## Run the bot

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` inside the `bot/` directory
3. Export the token into `.env`
4. Run `./start.sh`

All functionality we depend on has been migrated to Dyno, so we don't need to maintain more than what's in place.
If you want to contribute maintenance updates to the one feature, feel free to open a PR.
